# week1-assignment

the same movement I was attempting on the page, I had to read through w3school's page before catching my initial mistake and use it as a reference for the positioning of each section! I also had a little issue with button styling, not being able to add padding to the left and right sides of the button.

I challenged myself by playing with fonts and learning how to add fonts from google into my coding.
